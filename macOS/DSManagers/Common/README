This directory contains the common code used by several modules. None of the code here stands by itself, thus can not be tested independently.


Making the code:

If you will run simply "make", the default target "build" is executed and object files for this module are created. Use this for compiling the code.

Following targets are available in the top makefile

clean: Removes log files, object files, debug files.


distclean: Removes everything except source code, makefiles and config files
